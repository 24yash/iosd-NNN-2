This repo is my submission to the competetion Neural Network Nexus 2.0 (NNN) hosted by IOSD-MAIT.

# Project Structure Overview

This project follows a structured organization to manage its codebase and outputs effectively. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

## Code Files

### main.ipynb

The `main.ipynb` file contains the code for the main model. This model has been trained and evaluated, with its best results saved in the `predictions1.csv` file and the model itself saved as `model1.joblib`.

### merged.ipynb

The `merged.ipynb` file contains code related to the model is trained on merged data and generates predictions stored in `predictions2.csv` and model itself saved as `model2.joblib`.

### eda.ipynb

The `eda.ipynb` file contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) charts and insights. It serves as a crucial step in understanding the dataset's characteristics and patterns.

## File Outputs

- `predictions1.csv`: Contains predictions generated by the main model.
- `model1.joblib`: Serialized file storing the trained model.
- `predictions2.csv`: Predictions generated by model trained on merged data.
- `model2.joblib`: Serialized file storing the trained model on merged data.

This structure ensures clarity and organization within the project, facilitating ease of navigation and reproducibility of results.
